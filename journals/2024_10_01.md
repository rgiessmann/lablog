- pre-heat buffered reaction solutions #x30, #x43, #x44 to 37°C,  start at 7.10
- measure UV/Vis campaign RTG13
	- 2024-10-01-RTG13-...
	- measure air path only => -1, -2, -3
	- try different type of cuvettes from BIORAD -- show very high absorption => not to be used
	- measure air path again => -6
	- take a new Brand cuvette and measure it empty => -7
	- measure it with water => -8
	- => => looks good as usual; continue with this cuvette
- 7.43: measure pH values
	- calibration solutions (2024-06-27):
	- pH 4.11 @ 20.4°C
	- pH 7.08 @ 20.4°C
	- pH 10.02 @ 20.5°C
	- took until 7.53 to measure those three
	- #x30: pH 7.39 @ 37.1°C
	- ruined #x43 because it dropped into the water bath
	- #x44: 8.01 @ 34.5°C, 7.99 @ 36.9°C
- prepare #x48:
	- add 3x1000uL #x30 to fresh 15 mL falcon tube
	- 8h41 add 1 drop 0.4% HCl
	- pH 6.82 @ 34.6°C
	- pH 6.79 @ 35.9°C
	- pH 6.78 @ 36.5°C
	- pH 6.78 @ 36.8°C
	- pH 6.77 @ 37.0°C
- prepare #x49:
	- 8.52 add 3x1000uL #x30 to fresh 15 mL falcon tube
	- add 1 drop of 1M KOH
	- pH 9.6 @ 32.7°C
	- add 1 drop of 0.4% HCl
	- pH 9.3
	- add 1 drop of 0.4% HCl
	- pH 8.55 @ 33.9°C
	- pH 8.40 @ 35.9°C
	- pH 8.55 @ 33.9°C
- prepare #x50:
	- add 500uL #x30 to fresh 1.5 mL eppi
- prepare #x51:
	- add 500uL #x44 to fresh 1.5 mL eppi
- 8.23 pre-heat #x50 and #x51 in Eppendorf shaker
- prepare #x52 and #x53:
	- add to each: 500 uL #x48 to fresh 1.5 mL eppis

- continue RTG13:
	- check #x33 absorption
	- 8.30 measure air => -9
	- measure water => -10
	- empty cuvette and fill with fresh water => -11
	- empty cuvette and fill cuvette with 1000uL from stock #x33 bottle => -x33-naoh-11
	- empty cuvette and fill with water => -12
	- empty cuvette and fill cuvette with 1000uL from stock #x33 bottle => -x33-naoh-13
	- => absorption of x33 looks okay; still slightly elevated below 250nm, but this does not matter
