- pre-heat buffered reaction solutions #x30, #x43, #x44 to 37°C,  start at 7.10
- measure UV/Vis campaign RTG13
	- 2024-10-01-RTG13-...
	- measure air path only => -1, -2, -3
	- try different type of cuvettes from BIORAD -- show very high absorption => not to be used
	- measure air path again => -6
	- take a new Brand cuvette and measure it empty => -7
	- measure it with water => -8
	- => => looks good as usual; continue with this cuvette
- 7.43: measure pH values
	- calibration solutions (2024-06-27):
	- pH 4.11 @ 20.4°C
	- pH 7.08 @ 20.4°C
	- pH 10.02 @ 20.5°C
	- took until 7.53 to measure those three
	- #x30: pH 7.39 @ 37.1°C
	- ruined #x43 because it dropped into the water bath
	- #x44: 8.01 @ 34.5°C, 7.99 @ 36.9°C
	-
- continue RTG13:
	- check #x33 absorption
	- 8.30 measure air => -9
	- measure water => -10
	- empty cuvette and fill with fresh water => -11
	- empty cuvette and fill cuvette with 1000uL from stock #x33 bottle => -x33-naoh-11
	- empty cuvette and fill with water => -12
	- empty cuvette and fill cuvette with 1000uL from stock #x33 bottle => -x33-naoh-13
	- => absorption of x33 looks okay; still slightly elevated below 250nm, but this does not matter

	- add 500uL #x30 to fresh 1.5 mL eppi
- prepare #x51:
	- add 500uL #x44 to fresh 1.5 mL eppi
- 8.23 pre-heat #x50 and #x51 in Eppendorf shaker
- prepare #x52 and #x53:
	- add to each: 500 uL #x48 to fresh 1.5 mL eppis
	- pre-heat
- prepare #x54 and #x55:
	- add to each: 500 uL #x49 to fresh 1.5 mL eppis
	- pre-heat start at 8.59
-
- prepare sample eppis with 500ul of x33 each
- distribute 1ul of #x22 to all of #x50, #x51, #x52, #x53, #x54, #x55
- mix by inversion, start at 9.10, delay 20 seconds
- sample time points:
	- no t0!
	- t1 = 2 min
	- t2 = 5 min
	- t3 = 15 min
	- t4 = 44 min
	- t5 = 1h40min == 100 min
	- t6 = 2h43min == 163 min
	- t7 = 4h19min == 259 min
	- t8 = 5h19min == 319 min
- at 5h23, add 10uL #x26 phosphate
	- t9 = 5h25min == 325 min
	- t10 = 5h31min == 331 min
	- t11 = not existent;
	- t12 = 6h08min == 368 min
- 15h30 kill the experiment

- during RTG13, the following special things occured:
	- -x51-t7-72 showed high background (absorption higher than usual in the range 300--350 nm); wipe the cuvette and measure again => -x51-t7-wipe-cuv-and-repeat-meas-same-sample-73
	- when pipetting the late samples (from t8) into cuvette, it seemed that x50, x51 contained particles; x52 a little, and x53 more again
		- => this might be due to the used eppendorf tubes, maybe they were not very clean; or maybe it is  precipitation of enzyme?
		- => use fresh eppis for t12
			- => => indeed, less particles seen. Not sure whether it was really the eppis, or not. Would need further experimentation.
	- I changed the cuvette while measuring the t8--t10 series (after x54) and measured it with water == -new-cuvette-101
		- => indeed, the cuvette itself builds up dirt
		- => the air path measurements do not show any drift
	- x50 t12 == -106 showed high background (absorption higher than usual in the range 300--350 nm)
	- => wipe the cuvette, and remeasure it, with the same content and the same cuvette; really "just wiped" => -x50-t12-remeasure-same-sample-107
