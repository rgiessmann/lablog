- pre-heat buffered reaction solutions #x30, #x43, #x44 to 37°C,  start at 7.10
- measure UV/Vis campaign RTG13
	- 2024-10-01-RTG13-...
	- measure air path only => -1, -2, -3
	- try different type of cuvettes from BIORAD -- show very high absorption => not to be used
	- measure air path again => -6
	- take a new Brand cuvette and measure it empty => -7
	- measure it with water => -8
	- => => looks good as usual; continue with this cuvette
