- identify stocks:
	- received from BioNukleo:
	- #x21: Y02,
	- #x22: uridine, white solid, ~100mg
	- #x23: uracil, white solid, ~100mg
- #x24 uridine
	- MW 244.20 g/mol
	- ```calc
	  c=0.01 #M
	  V=1.0e-3 #L
	  n=c*V #mol
	  M=244.2 #g/mol
	  m_needed=n*M*1e3 #mg
	  m_real = 5.4 #g
	  water_to_add = m_real / m_needed
	  ```
	- weigh 5.4 mg #x22
	- 2.21 g water to be added; added 2.21 g water
	- => label "x24 Urd, 10 mM, 2024-05-13 RTG"
- #x25 uracil
	- MW 112.1 g/mol
	- ```calc
	  c=0.01 #M
	  V=1.0e-3 #L
	  n=c*V #mol
	  M=112.1 #g/mol
	  m_needed=n*M*1e3 #mg
	  m_real = 5.7 #mg
	  water_to_add = m_real / m_needed
	  ```
	- added 6.37g water by accident -- gives a concentration of:
	- ```calc
	  V=6.37e-3 #L
	  M=112.1 #g/mol
	  m=5.7*1e-3 #g
	  n=m/M #mol
	  c=n/V
	  ```
	- => 7.98 mM = approx 8 mM
	- => label "x25 Ura, 8mM, 2024-05-13 RTG"
	- observation: Ura hardly dissolves. => warm to 30Â°C in water bath. still not dissolved at 13h18
	- add 3 drops of 1M NaOH at 13h18
	- dissolves more or less, very tiny flakes stay at the bottom of the tube
- collect data at the platereader
	- pipette 200ul #x5 into one well, 300ul #x5, 200ul #x5 + 20ul #x24, 300ul #x5 + 20ul #x24, leave one well empty
	- try to measure absorbance with platereader -- does not work, because lowest possible wavelength is 340nm
	- abort experiment
- collect data at the #cary300
	- campaign 2024-05-13-RTG1...
		- measure air
		- set baseline to air
		- measure air again => -air
			- all zero, all good; the Cary300 has two different lamps, and switches over at 350nm (this can be adjusted in the settings) => visible difference in data quality
