	- received from BioNukleo:
	- #x21: Y02, LOT 20220429, 4.5 mg/mL
	- #x22: uridine, white solid, ~100mg
	- #x23: uracil, white solid, ~100mg
- #x24 uridine
	- MW 244.20 g/mol
	- ```calc
	  c=0.01 #M
	  V=1.0e-3 #L
	  n=c*V #mol
	  M=244.2 #g/mol
	  m_needed=n*M*1e3 #mg
	  m_real = 5.4 #g
	  water_to_add = m_real / m_needed
	  ```
	- weigh 5.4 mg #x22
	- 2.21 g water to be added; added 2.21 g water
	- => label "x24 Urd, 10 mM, 2024-05-13 RTG"
- #x25 uracil
	- MW 112.1 g/mol
	- ```calc
	  c=0.01 #M
	  V=1.0e-3 #L
	  n=c*V #mol
	  M=112.1 #g/mol
	  m_needed=n*M*1e3 #mg
	  m_real = 5.7 #mg
	  water_to_add = m_real / m_needed
	  ```
	- added 6.37g water by accident -- gives a concentration of:
	- ```calc
	  V=6.37e-3 #L
	  M=112.1 #g/mol
	  m=5.7*1e-3 #g
	  n=m/M #mol
	  c=n/V
	  ```
	- => 7.98 mM = approx 8 mM
	- => label "x25 Ura, 8mM, 2024-05-13 RTG"
	- observation: Ura hardly dissolves. => warm to 30°C in water bath. still not dissolved at 13h18
	- add 3 drops of 1M NaOH at 13h18
	- dissolves more or less, very tiny flakes stay at the bottom of the tube
- collect data at the platereader
	- pipette 200ul #x5 into one well, 300ul #x5, 200ul #x5 + 20ul #x24, 300ul #x5 + 20ul #x24, leave one well empty
	- try to measure absorbance with platereader -- does not work, because lowest possible wavelength is 340nm
	- abort experiment
- collect data at the #cary300
	- campaign 2024-05-13-RTG1...
		- measure air
		- set baseline to air
		- measure air again => -air
			- all zero, all good; the Cary300 has two different lamps, and switches over at 350nm (this can be adjusted in the settings) => visible difference in data quality
		- measure empty cuvette against this baseline => -1.DSW and -empty-cuvette-against-air-2.DSW
			- cuvette has Abs > 1.0 below 220nm => not usable there
		- use UV/Vis micro cuvettes
			- supplier: Brand, model # 7592 30, UV-Küvette mikro 70µ, LOT CW-012-4
			- description says: 70uL, but looks different
			- => test out the minimal volume needed
		- fill cuvette with 70uL #x5 naoh => -70uL-x5-naoh-against-air-3.DSW
			- spectrum looks same like empty cuvette
		- add 130 uL #x5 , now: total volume 200uL => -200uL-x5-naoh-against-air-4
			- spectrum looks different => probably being over the focus point
		- add 100 uL #x5 , now: total volume 300uL => -300uL-x5-naoh-against-air-5
			- spectrum looks different than with 200uL => reached over the focus point
		- add 300 uL #x5 , now: total volume 600uL => -600uL-x5-naoh-against-air-6
			- now filling volume is above the marked line on the cuvette
			- spectrum looks same as with 300uL filling volume => stabilized, all good
		- => minimal filling volume approx 300uL, (200uL is not enough)
		- add 3ul #x24 Urd, mix by swirling with pipette tip => -3ul-x24-urd-in-600uL-x5-naoh-against-air-7
			- difference in UV/Vis spectrum visible, significant approx below 280 (results below 220nm not really trustworthy, as cuvette absorbs too much)
	- campaign 2024-05-13-RTG2
		- recycle the same cuvette: wash three times with water, empty into waste
		- empty the cuvette as much as possible by flicking ; some water remains, this is okay
		- fill cuvette with 500uL #x5, measure => -same-cuvette-but-washed-500uL-x5-naoh-against-air-1
			- spectrum looks pretty pretty similar to 2024-05-13-RTG1-600uL-x5-naoh-against-air-6 => cuvette can be recycled and can be washed clean after use again
		- add 3ul #x25 (Ura) => -3ul-x25-ura-in-500uL-x5-naoh-against-air-2
	- campaign 2024-05-13-RTG3
		- reuse the cuvette from before, and keep the content within the cuvette
		- but: change the settings for recording the spectrum -- only record from 349nm to 220nm
		- => 2024-05-13-RTG3-test-2ul-x25-ura-in-500ul-x5-naoh-against-air
			- looks good
			- note that the naming is wrong (2uL-x25 should be 3ul-x25)
