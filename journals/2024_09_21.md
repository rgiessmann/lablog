- #x42 should show same results as #x45 , they were taken from the same stock solution -- 53.2 vs 54.8 % conversion ; this seems to be "our normal error" (1.5 percentage points!)
- When sampling shortly after each other (#x45, t = 49 min and 49.1 min), the difference was 0.9 percentage points -- this must be due to the fitting alone, this is not due to reaction in between.
