- take #x30 out from 4°C fridge. observation: solidified content. put to 37°C water bath. liquifies again.
- prepare #x32:
	- fill 500uL #x30 into eppi
	- start pre-heating at 37°C in eppendorf shaker at 8.20h
	- 10:47 add 3uL #x21 enzyme
	- sample at:
	- t0 = 12 seconds
	- t1 = 1 min
	- t2 = 2 min
	- t3 = 3 min
	- t4 = 4 min
	- t5 = 5 min
	- t6 = 10 min
	- t7 = 15 min 12 seconds
	- measure in #cary300-RTG9:
	- blank water => -blank-water-1
	- t0..t6 => -x32-t*
	- blank water => -blank-water-12
	- t7 => -x32-t7-13

		- purity >99.5% , Ph.Eur. quality
	- 250ml schott bottle, tara glass including pouring ring: 223.57g
	- add 0.84g naoh pastilles #stock-naoh-vwr to bottle
	- ```calc
	  .84/.8*200
	  ```
	- add 209.94g millipore water
	- label as "x33 RTG 2024-09-01 0.1M NaOH"
	- dissolve pastilles by regular swirling
- prepare #x34-kcl:
	- identify #stock-kcl-roth:
		- supplier Carl Roth
		- article number 6781.1 , 1 kg
		- lot 368274214
		- quality: >99.5%, p.a. ACS ISO
		- mw 74.56 g/mol
	- 100ml schott bottle, tara glass including pouring ring: 152.24g
	- ```calc
	  1.56/74.56*1000
	  ```
	- add 1.56g #stock-kcl-roth to bottle
	- add 20.92g water
- 09:19 : measure pH of #x30:
	- 7.42 @ 35.0°C
	- 09:37 after re-calibration: 7.38 @ 32.4°C
	- 09:39 7.36 @ 33.4°C
	- 09:45 7.40 @ 34.4°C
	- 7.37 @ 35.1°C
	- 7.38@ 35.1°C
	- 7.37 @ 35.3°C
- prepare #x35:
	- 15 ml falcon tube
	- fill with 2 mL (2x1000uL) #x30
	- add 2 mL water (2x1000uL)
	- let equilibrate temperature in water bath
	- measure pH
	- 09:39 7.39 @ 34.3°C
	- 7.40 @ 34.6°C
	- 7.37 @ 34.4°C
	- 7.37 @ 34.5°C
	- 7.38 @ 34.5°C
	- => conclusion: dilution did not change pH
	-
- prepare #x36:
	- 15 ml falcon tube
	- fill with 2 mL (2x1000uL) #x30
	- add 2 mL #x34-kcl (2x1000uL)
	- let equilibrate temperature in water bath
	- measure pH
	- 09:43 7.14 @ 34.0°C
	- 7.17 @ 34.1°C
	- 7.17 @ 34.4°C
	- 7.17 @ 34.3°C
	- conclusion => ionic strength did change the pH slightly
	-
- 09:33 re-calibrate pH meter
-
- reference: to cover the pH electrode within a 15 mL falcon tube, at least 2.5, better 3mL volume must be in. Maximum to cover pH electrode without spilling over is 5 mL volume within a 15 mL falcon tube.

- #cary300-RTG8:
	- 09:56 prepare sample "old" with 500uL #x5 naoh and "new" with 500 ul #x33-naoh
	- add 30uL #x35 to each
	- measure uv vis spectra
	- air only => 2024-09-01-RTG8-air-1
	- cuvette with water blank => -blank-water-2
	- measure #x5 naoh => -x5-3
	- measure #x33-naoh => -x33-4
	- => conclusion: #x5 absorbs more (approx 0.01 AU), #x33-naoh looks more like water;  divergence of all three below 240nm
	- => discard #x5 after measuring #x31 and #x29
	- measure water => -blank-water-5
	- add to "old" 60uL #x35 => -x35-old-6
	- add to "new" 60 ul #x35 => -x35-new-7
	- => big difference in absorption! :( will need to re-measure reference spectra
	- 10:18 measure #x29 in #x5 => timepoint ??? min (tx) => -x29-tx-8
	- 10:19 measure #x31 in #x5 => timepoint ??? min (tx) => -x31-tx-9
	- add 6uL #x24 urd to 500uL #x33 => -x24-x33-reference-10
	- add 7.5uL #x25 ura to 500uL #x33 => -x25-x33-reference-11
	- measure water => -blank-water-12
	- measure #x33 => -x33-13
	- => #x33 and water blank are identical
