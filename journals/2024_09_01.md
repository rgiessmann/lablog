- prepare #x35:
	- 15 ml falcon tube
	- fill with 2 mL (2x1000uL) #x30
	- add 2 mL water (2x1000uL)
	- let equilibrate temperature in water bath

	-
- 09:33 re-calibrate pH meter
-
- for my own reference: to cover the pH electrode within a 15 mL falcon tube, at least 2.5, better 3mL volume must be in. Maximum to cover pH electrode without spilling over is 5 mL volume within a 15 mL falcon tube.

- #cary300-RTG8:
	- 09:56 prepare sample "old" with 500uL #x5 naoh and "new" with 500 ul #x33-naoh

	- cuvette with water blank => -blank-water-2
	- measure #x5 naoh => -x5-3

	- => conclusion: #x5 absorbs more (approx 0.01 AU), #x33-naoh looks more like water;  divergence of all three below 240nm
	- => discard #x5 after measuring #x31 and #x29
	- measure water => -blank-water-5

- next goal: record conversion with changed pH
- prepare #x39 :
	- add 3x1000uL of #x30 to two new 15 mL falcon tubes
	- measure pH:
	- start 7.36 @ 37.7°C
	- 7.34 @ 38.0°C
	- add 1 drop 5 M KOH from common stock => 11.80 @ 38.1°C
	- add 5% HCl ; 2 drops => 6.23 @ 36.8°C
	- add 1 drop 0.4% HCl => 5.02 @ 37.1 °C
	- 4.96 @ 37.4°C
	- 5.00 @ 36.2°C
	- 14:17
	- 5.04 @ 35.3°C

- prepare #x40 :
	- add 3x1000uL of #x30 to two new 15 mL falcon tubes
	- 14:10
	- measure pH:
	- 7.31 @ 35.6°C
	- 7.34 @ 36.4°C
	- add 1 drop of 1 M KOH from common stock => 9.9 @ ??°C
	- add 1 drop of 0.4% HCl => 9.78 @ 36.0°C

	- prepare #x42:
		- add 1x1000uL of #x40 to eppi
		- pre-heat start at 14:23
	- start by addition of 6uL #x21 enzyme , 30 seconds delay between both samples , at 14:35
	- sample 30uL of each reaction solution into 500ul #x33-naoh
	- timepoints
		- t0 = 20 sec
		- t1 = 1 min
		- t2 = 2 min
		- t3 = 3 min
		- t4 = 5 min
		- t5 = 10 min
		- t6 = 15 min
		- t7 = 26 min 30 seconds

		- at 39.5 minutes, add 30ul #x21 enzyme to #x41
		- t9 = 43 min
		- t10 = 53 min
		- t12 = 60 min
		- TODO check the cary300 computer if there is the t12 file on it -- it is currently not checked-in to git
	- => #x42 at pH 9 shows conversion / yield of 51% -- not different from pH 7! --> prediction of eQuilibrator is wrong
	- => #x41 shows no or very very slow conversion ; maybe pH 5 is too acidic for the enzyme
	- TODO insert plot for #x41 and #x42
	- metadata file: 2024-09-01-cary300-RTG11-x41-x42.csv
		- ![_cond_1.svg](../assets/_cond_1_1726370392730_0.svg)
		- the addition of enzyme produced a big change in spectrum, but this is due to the absorption of the enzyme itself, not due to conversion. The conversion does not change after addition of the enzyme over time.
