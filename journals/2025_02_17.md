- UV/Vis campaign RTG18
	- 06h04: pre-heat #x69, #x72, #x75, #x78, #x81, #x84, #x87, #x90

	- --6h47: close the tubes
	- --6h51 : label the tubes
	-

	- => x90-t0-18
		- accidentally named -x91-t0-18; renamed on disk afterwards
	- => -water-19
	- discard cuvette, as the water spectrum shows more than 0.001 AU difference to first measurements at approx 240nm
		- => this was unnecessary, the cut-off would have been 0.01 AU
	- => air-20
	-

	- => -x75-t6-42
	- => -water-43
