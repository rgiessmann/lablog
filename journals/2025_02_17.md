	- fill cuvette with millipore water => -water-4
	- orientation: arrow to the left, BRAND logo to the right
	- fill with 400ul x57 naoh => -x57-naoh-5

	- prepare 7*8=56 sampling tubes
	- 6h38 -- 6h44: distribute 500uL x57 naoh to each tube
	- --6h47: close the tubes
	- --6h51 : label the tubes
	-
	- 6h54--6h58: sample 30uL each into t0 tubes
	- 6h58: measure in Cary300

		- => -x84-t0-16b
	- => x87-t0-17
	- => x90-t0-18
	- => -water-19
	- discard cuvette, as the water spectrum shows more than 0.001 AU difference to first measurements at approx 240nm
