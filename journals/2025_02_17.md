	- => -air-1 (800nm to 200nm)
	- => -air-2 (340nm to 220nm)
	- => -air-3
	- fill cuvette with millipore water => -water-4
	- orientation: arrow to the left, BRAND logo to the right
	- fill with 400ul x57 naoh => -x57-naoh-5
	- wash and fill with water => -water-6
	- fill with 400ul x57 naoh => -x57-naoh-7
	- wash and fill with water => -water-8
	- fill with 800ul x57 naoh => -x57-naoh-9
	-
	- prepare 7*8=56 sampling tubes
	- 6h38 -- 6h44: distribute 500uL x57 naoh to each tube
	- --6h47: close the tubes
	- --6h51 : label the tubes
	-
	- 6h54--6h58: sample 30uL each into t0 tubes
	- 6h58: measure in Cary300
	- fill with water => water-10

		- contained a bubble and a bit of dust; remove with pipette tip from light path and remeasure:
		- => -x84-t0-16b
	- => x87-t0-17
	- => x90-t0-18
	- => -water-19
	- discard cuvette, as the water spectrum shows more than 0.001 AU difference to first measurements at approx 240nm
		- => this was unnecessary, the cut-off would have been 0.01 AU
	- => air-20
	-
	- 7h25 distribute 2 uL of #x21 enzyme to each of the lids of the reaction tubes
	- 7h29 start reaction with 15 seconds difference between each sample

	-
	- 7h48 start distributing 500ul into 4*8=32 sampling tubes
	- 7h51 close tubes
	- 7h51--7h54 label tubes
	-
	- 8h36 start to measure samples again
