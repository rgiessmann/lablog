	- 0.0188 g #x22 uridine
	- weigh recipient: now 13.10g
	- add h2o, to total weight: 52.13g ==> added 38.03g h2o
	- 07:31 done
	- close falcon, shake to start dissolution, label with "x56 RTG 2024-11-22"
	- 07:34 put into water bath at 37.0°C to dissolve and reach temperature
	-
- check #x33 -- contains particles; discard and prepare new naoh
	- prepare #x57-naoh:
		- take bottle from old #x33 and clean it multiple times with milliq water
		- identify #stock-naoh-vwr
			- supplier VWR
			- article # 28248.298 , 1 kg
			- LOT 11D120014
		- 250ml schott bottle, tara glass including pouring ring: 223.57g
		- add 0.86g naoh pastilles #stock-naoh-vwr to bottle
		- ```calc
		  40g per 1 L == 1 M 
		  4g per 1 L == 0.1 M
		  0.4g per 100 mL == 0.1
		  V = 0.86/0.4*100
		  215+223.57
		  438.29
		  215-(438.57-438.29)
		  ```
		- fill water to total weight of 438.29g ==> added 214.72g millipore water (should have been 215.00g)
		- label as "x57 RTG 2024-11-22 0.1M NaOH"
		- dissolve pastilles by regular swirling
		- 08:05
- check #x55 buffer : all particles dissolved
	- measure pH
	- 7.41 @ 33.7 °C
	- 7.41 @ 34.6 °C
	- 7.40 @ 35.0 °C
- prepare #x58:
	- transfer approx 10 mL from #x56 to a fresh 50 mL falcon tube
	- measure pH
	- 7.40 @ 33.0°C
	- 7.38  @ 34.5°C
	- 08:22
	- 7.37 @ 36.5°C
	- 7.36 @ 36.6°C
	- 7.36 @ 36.9°C
	- 7.35 @ 37.0°C
	- 7.36 @ 37.0°C
- prepare #x59:
	- sample 500uL from #x58
	- 08:32 start pre-heat in eppendorf thermoblock
- prepare #x60 and #x61:
	- #x60: add 6uL #x24 urd to 500uL #x57 sampling tube
	- #x61: add 7.5uL #x25 ura to 500uL #x57 sampling tube
- UV/Vis campaign RTG14
	- 2024-11-22-RTG14-...
	- 08:38 sample 30uL from #x59 (t0 or t-1, actually...) => -3
	- measure air path => -1-air (wrong naming pattern...)
	- measure air path => -air-2
	- take a fresh cuvette (that one has black marks; strange); BRAND uv/vis, lot "M 289-6"
	- fill with water => -water-3
	- fill with x57 => -x57-blank-4
	- fill with water => -water-5
		- => strange behavior, (absorption goes up and down when comparing water and naoh) =>  take another cuvette
	- fill with water => -water-6
		- => very differnet absorption! +0.05 AU compared to previous cuvette...
	- fill with water => -water-7
	- fill with 1000uL x57 => -x57-blank-8
		- => looks much better
	- fill with water => -water-9
	- fill with 400uL x57 => -x57-blank-10
		- => much higher absorption
	- keep cuvette content, repeat measurement => -x57-blank-11
		- => again different absorption
	- add 400uL, so total is 800uL => -x57-blank-12
		- => looks better
	- clean and fill with 400uL 57 => -x57-blank-13
		- => again higher absorption
	- add 50uL, so total is 450uL => -x57-blank-14
		- => still high
	- add 50uL, so total is 500uL => -x57-blank-15
		- => still high
	- 550 => -16
		- => better
	- 600 => -17
		- => good
	- put an "adaptor" into the chamber
	- 600 => -18
	- remove 100uL from cuvette, so total is 500 => -19
	- remove 100uL from cuvette, so total is 400 => -20
	- remove 100uL from cuvette, so total is 300 => -21
		- => too little, absorption changes!
	- add 50uL to cuvette, so total is 350 => -22
		- => still not enough
	- add 50uL to cuvette, so total is 400 => -23
	- add 50uL to cuvette, so total is 450 => -24
		- => 400 and 450 same
	- fill with water => -water-25
	- 09:19 fill with 400uL  x57 => -x47-blank-26
	- fill with water => -water-27
	- fill with water => -28
	- fill with water => -29
	- fill with #x60 => -x60-uridine-30
		- => contains particles!! but spectrum looks fine
	- fill with water => -water-31
	- fill with #x60 => -x61-uracil-32
		- => no particles...
	- fill with water => -water-33
	- fill with x59-t0 => -x59-t0-34
		- => contains particles!! but spectrum looks fine. where do those particles come from?!
	- fill with water => -water-35
	- check for particles:
		- test another eppi and transfer to cuvette, seems dirty again
		- test another eppi -- observe that actually the pipetting tip seems to carry along "hairy" particles!
		- check a few other tips -- yes, they all carry "hairs"! What?!!!!
		- discard this tip box and take a new one
	- 09:43
- UV/Vis campaign RTG15
	- check a 4 tips from the new box, all looks good
	- take a new cuvette from lot M289-6
	- -air-1
	- fill with 500uL naoh from one sampling eppi => -x57-blank-2
		- => baseline is approx. 0.04AU lower than previous cuvette
	- fill with water => -water-3
		- => baseline consistent with x57 naoh
- start enzyme reaction #x59:
	- pipette 2uL #x21 into lid
	- mix by inversion, start at 9.54
	- sample time points:
		- t0 previously done
		- t1 = 10 sec
		- t2 = 1 min
		- t3 = 2 min
		- t4 = 3 min
		- t5 = 5min
		- t6 = 8min
		- t7 = 23min
		- t8 = 43min
		- t9 = 55min
- continue RTG15
	- -water-4
	- -x59-t1-5
		- => some small particles :(
	- -t2-6
		- => no particles, looks good
	- -t3-7
		- => no particles, looks good
	- -t4-8
	- -t5-9
	- -t6-10
	- -water-11
- 10:43 measure pH of x58
	- pH 7.44 @ 31.4°C
	- 7.39 @ 34.3°C
	- 7.37 @ 35.5°C
	- 7.35 @ 36.5
	- 10:51
- start titration of x58
	- 1 drop of 0.4% HCl => pH 7.11 @ 36.5°C
	- => #x62 pH 7.11 @ 36.6°C, sample 500uL out of x58
	- add 2 drops of 0.4% HCl => pH 6.67 @ 36.4°C => use for #x63
	- add 1 drop of 0.4% HCl => pH 6.41 @ 36.4°C
	- add 1 drop of 0.4% HCl => pH 6.31 @ 34.3°C
	- pH 6.30@35.5°C
	- 11:01 6.29@36.1°C
	- 6.30@36.5°C => use for #x64
	- add 2 drops of 0.4% HCl => pH 5.44 @ 36.6°C => use for #x65
