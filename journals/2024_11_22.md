- start to work in lab at 6:35
- #phmeter check calibration:
	- last calibration 2024-10-22 13h41
	- check with calibration buffers from 2024-06-28
	- 6:39--. 42   pH 3.98 @ 18.2°C
	- 6.42--.45   pH 7.01 @ 18.2 °C
	- 6.45--.48   pH 10.16 @ 18.2 °C

- prepare #x56 universal buffered reaction solution
	- recipient: 50 mL falcon tube, tara 12.83g empty including cap, 9.83g without cap (only tube), 12.8359 on analytical scale including cap
	- with weighing paper:
	- 0.0566 g citrate
	- 0.0458 g hepes
	- 0.0262 g taurin
	- 0.0212 g proline
	- 0.0892 g phosphate
	- 07:22 still weighing...
	- 0.0188 g #x22 uridine
	- weigh recipient: now 13.10g
	- add h2o, to total weight: 52.13g ==> added 38.03g h2o
	- 07:31 done
	- close falcon, shake to start dissolution, label with "x56 RTG 2024-11-22"
	- 07:34 put into water bath at 37.0°C to dissolve and reach temperature
	-
- check #x33 -- contains particles; discard and prepare new naoh
	- prepare #x57-naoh:
		- take bottle from old #x33 and clean it multiple times with milliq water
		- identify #stock-naoh-vwr
			- supplier VWR
			- article # 28248.298 , 1 kg
			- LOT 11D120014
		- 250ml schott bottle, tara glass including pouring ring: 223.57g
		- add 0.86g naoh pastilles #stock-naoh-vwr to bottle
		- ```calc
		  40g per 1 L == 1 M 
		  4g per 1 L == 0.1 M
		  0.4g per 100 mL == 0.1
		  V = 0.86/0.4*100
		  215+223.57
		  438.29
		  215-(438.57-438.29)
		  ```
		- fill water to total weight of 438.29g ==> added 214.72g millipore water (should have been 215.00g)
		- label as "x57 RTG 2024-11-22 0.1M NaOH"
		- dissolve pastilles by regular swirling
		- 08:05
- check #x55 buffer : all particles dissolved
	- measure pH
	- 7.41 @ 33.7 °C
	- 7.41 @ 34.6 °C
	- 7.40 @ 35.0 °C
- prepare #x58:
	- transfer approx 10 mL from #x56 to a fresh 50 mL falcon tube
	- measure pH
	- 7.40 @ 33.0°C
	- 7.38  @ 34.5°C
	- 08:22
	- 7.37 @ 36.5°C
	- 7.36 @ 36.6°C
	- 7.36 @ 36.9°C
	- 7.35 @ 37.0°C
	- 7.36 @ 37.0°C
- prepare #x59:
	- sample 500uL from #x58
	- 08:32 start pre-heat in eppendorf thermoblock
- prepare #x60 and #x61:
	- #x60: add 6uL #x24 urd to 500uL #x57 sampling tube
	- #x61: add 7.5uL #x25 ura to 500uL #x57 sampling tube
- UV/Vis campaign RTG14
	- 2024-11-22-RTG14-...
	- 08:38 sample 30uL from #x59 (t0 or t-1, actually...) => -3
	- measure air path => -1-air (wrong naming pattern...)
	- measure air path => -air-2
	- take a fresh cuvette
	- fill with water => -water-3
	- fill with x57 => -x57-blank-4
	- fill with water => -water-5
		- => strange behavior, (absorption goes up and down when comparing water and naoh) =>  take another cuvette
	- fill with water => -water-6
		- => very differnet absorption! +0.05 AU compared to previous cuvette...
	- fill with water => -water-7
