- start to work in lab at 6:35
- #phmeter check calibration:
	- last calibration 2024-10-22 13h41
	- check with calibration buffers from 2024-06-28
	- 6:39--. 42   pH 3.98@ 18.2°C
	- 6.42--.   pH

- prepare #x universal buffered reaction solution
	- recipient: 50 mL falcon tube, tara 12.84g empty, 12.8401 on analytical scale
	- with weighing paper, try:
	- actual: 0.0435 g citrate (intended: 44.1 mg)
	- actual: 0.0359 g hepes (intended: 35.7 mg)
	- actual: 0.0196 g taurin (intended: 18.8 mg)
	- actual: 0.0167 g proline (intended: 17.3 mg)
	- actual: 0.0705 g phosphate (intended: 68.5 mg)
	- actual: 0.0146 g uridine (intended: 14.7 mg)
	- weigh recipient: now 13.05g
	- add pre-warmed h2o up to 36.31g (filled with approx 25 mL)
	- hold to temperature on heating plate while adjusting the pH
	- measure pH = 7.41 @ 31.8°C
	- weigh recipient: now 36.21g (lost 0.02g while measuring pH => acceptable)
	- add more h2o to 43.07g (== 30.04g)
	- measure pH: 7.43 @ 31.1°C
	- pH: 7.39 @ 32.8 °C
	- 12h31: take 500uL => #x31
	- pH: 7.37 @ 35.1 °C
	- pH: 7.35 @ 37.3 °C
