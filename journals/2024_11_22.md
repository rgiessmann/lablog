- prepare #x56 universal buffered reaction solution
	- recipient: 50 mL falcon tube, tara 12.83g empty including cap, 9.83g without cap (only tube), 12.8359 on analytical scale including cap
	- with weighing paper:
	- 0.0566 g citrate
	- 0.0458 g hepes
	- 0.0262 g taurin
	- 0.0212 g proline
	- 0.0892 g phosphate
	- 07:22 still weighing...
	- 0.0188 g #x22 uridine
	- weigh recipient: now 13.10g
	- add h2o, to total weight: 52.13g ==> added 38.03g h2o
	- 07:31 done
	- close falcon, shake to start dissolution, label with "x56 RTG 2024-11-22"
	- 07:34 put into water bath at 37.0째C to dissolve and reach temperature

- check #x33 -- contains particles; discard and prepare new naoh
	- prepare #x33-naoh:
		- take bottle from old #x33 and clean it multiple times with milliq water
		- identify #stock-naoh-vwr
			- supplier VWR
			- article # 28248.298 , 1 kg
			- LOT 11D120014
			- purity >99.5% , Ph.Eur. quality
		- 250ml schott bottle, tara glass including pouring ring: 223.57g
		- add 0.86g naoh pastilles #stock-naoh-vwr to bottle
		- ```calc
		  40g per 1 L == 1 M 
		  4g per 1 L == 0.1 M
		  0.4g per 100 mL == 0.1
		  V = 1.00/0.4*100
		  ```
		- add 209.94g millipore water
		- label as "x33 RTG 2024-09-01 0.1M NaOH"
		- dissolve pastilles by regular swirling
