- 12:00 arrived in the lab
- 12:55 start working
- measure NAD #x4 again:
	- 1. measure #x5 against x5:
		- wash cuvette with #x5 once, then measure baseline with 500uL x5; then measure the same solution again (against its own baseline)
		- looks all good, except for noise <230nm
	- 2. prepare #x9
		- pipette 2x500uL #x5 with #p1000 and 5uL #x4 with #p10 into eppi, mix by inversion => #x9
		- wash cuvette once with 500uL #x9, empty it
		- pipette 500uL x9 into cuvette
		- measure
			- peak appears a little broader than at lower pH, but Absorption is quite low, A(260)~0.2
	- 3. prepare #x10
		- pipette 2x500uL #x5 with #p1000 and 20uL #x4 with #p20 into eppi, mix by inversion => #x9
		- wash cuvette once with 500uL #x10, empty it
		- pipette 500uL x10 into cuvette
		- measure
			- peak appears indeed broader than at lower pH, but peak absorption is quite similar, A(260)~0.45
		- => 2024-03-28-RTG2-x10
	- 4. measure #x5 against water:
		- wash cuvette five times with water from bottle
		- fill 500uL h2o into cuvette, measure baseline
		- wash cuvette once with 500uL #x5, empty it
		- pipette 500uL x5 into cuvette
		- measure
			- baseline looks okay, but indeed noise <230nm
		- => 2024-03-28-RTG2-x5-against-h2o
