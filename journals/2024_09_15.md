- doing re-evaluation when
	- varying isosbestic point => does have an influence on "yield"
	- varying start and end wavelength => has an influence
	- turning off isosbestic-point-correction and turning on scaling instead => does have an influence
	- using different blanks => has an influence
	- => oh-oh.
