- doing re-evaluation when
	- varying isosbestic point => does have an influence on "yield"
	- varying start and end wavelength => has an influence
	- turning off isosbestic-point-correction and turning on scaling instead => does have an influence
	- using different blanks => has an influence
	- => oh-oh.
	- previous setting was: 240 to 349nm, with isosbestic point at 271nm
	- => decide to use 250 to 349nm, and turn on scaling (turn off isosbestic point)
	- => => all the previous results have changed
