- 07:00 arrived in the lab
- prepare 100mM NaOH #x5
	- Fluka 71692, puriss. p.a., >97.0% ; LOT : 7339A 50508C03 , MW=40.0 g/mol
	- ```calc
	  c=0.1 #M
	  V=0.1 #L
	  c=n/V
	  n=c*V #mol
	  M=40.0 #g/mol
	  m=n*M #g
	  ```
	- Schott bottle 100mL, tara incl pourin ring: 148.24g, incl. label => **148.33g**
	- (tara incl. cap incl label: 179.08g)
	- intended weight NaOH: 0.4000g; actual => **0.3930g**
	- ```calc
	  0.3930/0.4*100+148.33
	  ```
	- bring NaOH pellets into some water, fill up to **246.58 g**
	- label as : x5 RTG NaOH 0.1M 2024-03-25"
- measure NAD x4 again:
	- find a nice quartz cuvette -- found one with ~700uL capacity, 1.000cm path length
	- 1. measure air: 2024-03-25-RTG1-air
	- 2. measure empty cuvette against air: 2024-03-25-RTG1-cuvette-against-air -- looks okay, absorption across all wavelengths (200-400nm) is A < 0.001
	- 3. measure with water to find measurement focus point: (series 2024-03-25-RTG1-xxxuL-water)
		- with 200 uL water -- absorption increased against air
		- with 400 uL water -- absorption **de**creased against 200uL water
		- with 600uL water -- absorption same as 400uL
			- => focus point is below 400uL
		- with 800uL water -- same
	- 4. measure
