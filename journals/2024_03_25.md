- 07:00 arrived in the lab
- prepare 100mM NaOH #x5
	- Fluka 71692, puriss. p.a., >97.0% ; LOT : 7339A 50508C03 , MW=40.0 g/mol
	- ```calc
	  c=0.1 #M
	  V=0.1 #L
	  c=n/V
	  n=c*V #mol
	  M=40.0 #g/mol
	  m=n*M #g
	  ```
	- Schott bottle 100mL, tara incl pourin ring: 148.24g, incl. label => **148.33g**
	- (tara incl. cap incl label: 179.08g)
	- intended weight NaOH: 0.4000g; actual => **0.3930g**
	- ```calc
	  0.3930/0.4*100+148.33
	  ```
	- bring NaOH pellets into some water, fill up to **246.58 g**
	- label as : x5 RTG NaOH 0.1M 2024-03-25"
- measure NAD x4 again:
	- find a nice quartz cuvette -- found one with ~700uL capacity, 1.000cm path length
	- 1. measure air: 2024-03-25-RTG1-air
	- 2. measure empty cuvette against air: 2024-03-25-RTG1-cuvette-against-air -- looks okay, absorption across all wavelengths (200-400nm) is A < 0.001
	- 3. measure with water to find measurement focus point: (series 2024-03-25-RTG1-xxxuL-water)
		- with 200 uL water -- absorption increased against air
		- with 400 uL water -- absorption **de**creased against 200uL water
		- with 600uL water -- absorption same as 400uL
			- => focus point is below 400uL
		- with 800uL water -- same
	- 4. measure water baseline and correct with it: 2024-03-25-RTG1-800ul-water-against-water-baseline
		- looks good
	- 5. measure x4:
		- empty cuvette into waste, then fill with 500uL water, then add 5uL #x4 -- problem with mixing, cannot insert pipette tip sufficiently ; measure nevertheless => 2024-03-25-RTG1-500uLwater-5ul-x4
			- peak at 260nm, A=0.2
		- add another 5uL #x4 , measure: 2024-03-25-RTG1-500ulwater-10ul-x4
			- A(260nm)=0.5 => does not scale linearly compared with 500ul water + 5ul x4
				- => repeat with premixed solution
	- 6. measure pre-mixed x4 dilutions in water
		- prepare #x6: into an eppi, add 2x500uL water with #p1000 , add 20uL #x4 with #p20
		- mix by inversion
		- wash emptied cuvette once with #x6 : add 500ul, empty it again
		- add #x6 into emptied cuvette and measure: 2024-03-25-RTG1-x6; A(260)=0.43
	- 7. measure x4 dilutions in glycine
		- wash cuvette with #x1 twice
		- measure x1 against water baseline: 2024-03-25-RTG1-blank-x1-against-water-baseline
			- negative absorption 244--300nm, then high peak <240nm.
				- => glycine is an amino acid; didn't think about it before, sure it absorbs there.
				- => record new baseline
		- measure x1 against x1 baseline: 2024-03-25-RTG1-blank-x1-against-x1
			- => high noise <230nm
		- prepare #x7: into an eppi, add 2x500uL x1 with #p1000 , add 20uL #x4 with #p20
		- empty cuvette and wash it wish x7 once
		- measure #x7 : 2024-03-25-RTG1-x7
			- A(260)=0.45 ; peak looks somewhat the same; trace not usable below 230nm
	- 8. measure x4 dilution in MOPS
		- empty cuvette
		- wash 3 times with water
		- measure baseline, 2024-03-25-RTG1-water-again
			- looks good
		- wash with x2 and measure x2 against water baseline: 2024-03-25-RTG1-x2
			- slighly higher absorbance in all wavelengths (A=0.005), but peak <260nm
		- record new baseline + remeasure: 2024-03-25-RTG1-x2-baseline
			- baseline okay, but high noise <240nm
		- prepare #x8: into an eppi, add 2x500uL x2 with #p1000 , add 20uL #x4 with #p20, mix by inversion
		- empty cuvette and wash it with x8 once
		- measure #x8 against x1 baseline: 2024-03-25-RTG1-x8
			- A(260)=0.43 ; trace not usable below 240nm
- wash cuvette 3 times with water, leave to dry

- observation: #x1 and #x2 solutions have particles in them at the bottom of the bottle, which can be swirled around
