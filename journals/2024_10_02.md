- evaluation of RTG13:
	- some spectra showed higher background, e.g. this:
		- ![fit_cond_1_t_259.0.svg](../assets/fit_cond_1_t_259.0_1727874897802_0.svg)
	- enzyme was still active in all pHs measured, e.g. this:
		- ![01_Conversion_rates_cond_3_Substrate.svg](../assets/01_Conversion_rates_cond_3_Substrate_1727874877857_0.svg)
	- => accept the experiment; but: check the spectra of equilibrium points used; possibly exclude them
- bring results, as far as available, together:
	- ![image.png](../assets/image_1727875943224_0.png)
	- => looks good! Need to check that enzyme stays active at pH 6 and pH 9, but the trend looks plausible
