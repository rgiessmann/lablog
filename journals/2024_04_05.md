- measure pH of #x2 again
	- pH = 7.55
- identify #stock-lactic-acid
	- stored in chemical cupboard 311, take it to my bench
	- supplier: Sigma; article nr. l-1375, 500mL, LOT 16H5049, DL-lactic acid as sodium salt, 60%(w/w) syrup; density 1.32 g/mL, MW=112.1g/mol
- prepare #x11 (lactic acid dilution)
	- 100mL schott bottle, tara 147.88g
	- add a bit of #stock-lactic-acid => weight 153.38g => 5.5 g added
		- ```calc
		  170.94-153.38
		  ```
	- add water to 170.94g => 17.56 g added
	- titrate pH with 1M NaOH and acetic acid
		- start: pH = 4.91
		- add 10 drops NaOH => pH = 4.99
		- add 20 drops NaOH => pH = 5.42
		- add 20 drops NaOH => pH = 11.63
		- add 5 drops acetic acid => pH = 5.5
		- add 10 drops NaOH => pH = 7.1
	- total concentration approximately 1.7 M (half of it for L-lactic acid => ~ 0.8 mol/L):
		- ```calc
		  m=5.5 #g
		  m=m*.6 #concentration in w/w
		  M = 112.1 #g/mol
		  n=m/M #mol
		  V=17.56*1e-3 #L
		  c=n/V

- UV/Vis campaign RTG3:
	- start with filling a big cuvette (3mL filling volume) stepwise and measure absorption to find out minimal filling volume
		- measure air => 2024-04-05-RTG3-1-big-cuvette-measurements.csv
		- add 500uL h2o =>2024-04-05-RTG3-2-big-cuvette-measurements-500ul.csv

		- 2024-04-05-RTG3-6-big-cuvette-measurements-2500ul.csv
		- reduce scan rate to get a smoother signal => 2024-04-05-RTG3-7-big-cuvette-measurements-2500ul-scan-rate-medium.csv
		- reset baseline to water blank, and measure again => 2024-04-05-RTG3-8-big-cuvette-measurements-h2o-against-h2o.csv
	- prepare #x12
		- add to cuvette: 500 uL h2o, 1000uL #x11 (lactic acid dilution), 500 uL #x2 (MOPS buffer pH 7.5) => 2024-04-05-RTG3-9-big-cuvette-measurements-x12-half-against-h2o.csv
			- shows strong absorption <250nm
		- add 10uL #stock-ldh => precipitate forms immediately; measure => 2024-04-05-RTG3-10-x12-with-enz-against-h2o.csv
		- add 20uL #x4 (NAD+) =>2024-04-05-RTG3-11-x12.csv
		- measure again (07:24:42) =>2024-04-05-RTG3-12-x13.csv
			- naming is incorrect, shouldn't be "-x13"
		- measure again (07:32:23) =>2024-04-05-RTG3-13-x12.csv
		- no reaction observed
		- add 20uL #stock-ldh => 2024-04-05-RTG3-x12-20uL-more-enz-14.csv
		- 7:36 : start water bath to set temperature to 30°C (is 18°C)
		- 7:43: water bath reached 30°C
		- add more NAD#: add 20uL #x4 => 2024-04-05-RTG3-x12-add-20ul-x4-19.csv
		- add 20uL #x4 => 2024-04-05-RTG3-x12-add-20ul-x4-20.BSW
		- measure again => -21, -22
		- add 100uL #x11 =>2024-04-05-RTG3-x12-add-100ul-x11-23.csv
		- measure again after time => -24, --25
		- add 100uL h2o to see how dilution affects the measurement result => -26
		- measure again after time => -27
		- stop the experiment; there seems to occur no reaction here
- prepare #x13 , UV/Vis campaign RTG4:
	- pipette into cuvette: 1500 uL h2o, 500 uL #x2
		- measure => 2024-04-05-RTG4-x13-30
	- add 20uL #stock-ldh => -31 (shows precipitate)
	- measure again => -32
	- add 20uL #x4 (NAD+)=> -33
	- measure twice again => -34, -35
	- add 5uL #x11 (lactic acid) => -36
	- measure again => -37
	- add 20uL #x11 => -38
	- measure again => -39
	- measure again => -40
	- stop experiment; there occurs no reaction
