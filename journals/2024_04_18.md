- prepare #x16:
	- get a #stock-sh1 from Janna (stored in -80°C freezer in basement)
		- 65.54mg/mL protein concentration; Janna determined 53.73 U/mg activity
	- thaw it by warming it in the hands
	- pipette into small Eppi: 5uL from SH1 5.6.23 (CoSH) + 95uL #x14 Tris -> 1:20 dilution
- prepare #x17:
	- pipette 50uL from #x16 + 450uL x14 Tris into new Eppi -> 1:200 dilution

- UV/Vis campaign RTG5
	- to cuvette add: 1.9mL x14, h2 saturated
	- lock with rubber stopper, gas with h2
	- add 50uL #x15 NAD+ with Hamilton syringe through stopper
	- add 5uL #x16 enzyme dilution with Hamilton syringe through stopper
	- measure A340 in kinetics mode => 2024-04-18-RTG5.csv
	- A340 absorption goes straight up, with slope ~= 1 AU / min
		- Janna comments: ideally should be slope=0.6
-
- UV/Vis campaign RTG6
	- prepare #x18:
		- to cuvette add: 1.9mL #x14, h2 saturated
		- lock with rubber stopper, gas with h2
		- add 50uL #x15 NAD+
		- measure => 2024-04-18-RTG6.csv
			- A340 stable at approx 0.206 in kinetics mode
		- turn to scan mode
		- measure baseline to air; add cuvette and scan -> 2024-04-18-RTG-t1 (A340=.12)
			- A>1.0 below 288nm => unusable there ; this are normal optical glas cuvettes, so very intransparent there
		- start a stopwatch:
		- add 10uL #x17 enzyme (1:200 dilution) at 0min10 stop watch time (i.e. when stop watch shows 10 seconds, add enzyme)
		- start scan at 0min30 stop watch -> t2
			- A340=0.28
		- start scan at 1min30 stop watch -> t3
			- A340=0.63
		- start scan at 2min30 stop watch -> t4
			- A340=1.16
		- start scan at 4min30 stop watch -> t5
			- A340>2
			- already unusable from here on
- UV/Vis campaign RTG7:
	- prepare #x19 as before: to cuvette add: 1.9mL x14, h2 saturated
	- lock with rubber stopper, gas with h2
	- measure cuvette -> 2024-08-18-RTG-blank
	- add 10uL #x4 with Hamilton syringe (was the one that was used for enzyme before :( ); measure -> -t0
		- A340 = 0.07
	- change method to measure down to 200nm again; measure -> -t1
	- add 5uL #x17 enzyme at delay 0min10
	- start measurement at 0min35 -> t2
		- A340 = 0.069
	- start measurement at 1min30 -> t3
		- A340 = 0.070
	- start measurement at 3min00 -> t4
		- A340 = 0.069
	- start measurement at 22min30 -> t5
		- A340 = 0.021
	- => probably too little NAD+ to get the reaction really started (K_M too low?), or too little NADH formed to be seen?
- UV/VIs campaign RTG8:
	- prepare #x20: to cuvette add: 1.9mL x14, h2 saturated
	- lock with rubber stopper, gas with h2
	- start to measure in kinetic mode => 2024-04-18-RTG7-t5.csv
	- add 50uL #x15 NAD+ at approx 1min00, remove cuvette from spectrophotometer, mix by slight shaking of cuvette, reinsert cuvette
	- add 20uL #x17 enzyme dilution (1:200) at approx 3min00, remove cuvette from spectrophotometer, mix by slight shaking of cuvette, reinsert cuvette
		- => slope 0.7
		- in total, this cuvette contained the enzyme in 20/2000 = 1/100 parts; with 1:200 dilution: a total of 1:20,000 dilution (of 65.54mg/mL) => enzyme concentration was 3.3ug/mL ; a total of 6.55ug enzyme was added to this cuvette
		- the cuvette contained 1mM NAD+ ; i.e. a total of 2umol NAD+ was in this cuvette
